## ASUS Aura Sync Ene.sys stack overflow exploit

As documented [here](https://zer0-day.pw/2020-06/asus-aura-sync-stack-based-buffer-overflow/), this driver includes multiple IOCTLs that lead to a vulnerable function in the driver. 

## Local BSOD proof-of-concept

The DOS.cpp exploit will trigger this vulnerability by writing a user buffer of 41's to the driver with a large size

## Windows versions

Tested to be working on Windows 10 1607
